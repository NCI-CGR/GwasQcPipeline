GwasQcPipeline Documentation
============================

The |cgr| generates a number of sample level QC metrics followed by several filtering criteria.
Samples are then split into ancestral populations and examined for relatedness, population structure, and genotyping errors.
The full workflow is pictured in :numref:`fig-full-pipeline`.

|cgr| is designed to be an easy to deploy to multiple cluster systems.
It is built on top of snakemake_ but packaged into as an easy to install python utility.
This lets us take advantage of snakemake_'s amazing workflow management system, while adding a custom library of helper tools.

|cgr| is broken into 5 sub-workflows.
Each sub-workflow can be run independently, as long as all previous sub-workflows are complete.
For example, the *Sample QC* sub-workflow requires the *Entry Points* sub-workflow (and optionally the *Contamination*) to be complete.
Here we describe the various steps that each sub-workflow runs, the config options, and a summary of the generated outputs.
