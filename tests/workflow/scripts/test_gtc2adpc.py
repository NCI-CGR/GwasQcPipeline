    """Issue 31: Regression difference NA vs 0.0

    I found when using real data my version of the script returns `nan` and
    the production version of the script is returning ~0. After some digging
    I found some small differences in the Illumina parsing library when x or
    y raw are 0. The `nan` is the current Illumina implementation and is
    probably the right value to use.

    This test shows that when these do occur, they only occur when the raw
    values are 0, genotype score is 0, and the genotype call is 3 (Unknown).
