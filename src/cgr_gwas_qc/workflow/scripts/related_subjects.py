related_subjects.py
-------------------

Uses IBS/IBD to identify putative relationships among subjects within a
population. Any two subjects whose ``PI_HAT`` is greater than the user
defined ``pi_hat_threshold`` [1] will be considered related.

Output:

    ``{prefix}/subjects_relatives_pi_hat_gt{pi}.csv``

    This table contains information about which subjects appear to be related
    according to IBS/IBD. An arbitrary family ID is assigned to help tracking.

    1. Uses ``PI_HAT`` from IBS/IBD estimation to identify pairwise groups of
    related subjects.
    2. Builds a graph where subjects (nodes) are connected by edges if their
    ``PI_HAT`` was above the ``pi_hat_threshold`` [1].
    3. Each connected subgraph is then considered a "QC_Family".

    .. csv-table::
        :header: name, description

        **QC_Family_ID** (*index*), An arbitrary ID assigned to each related set of subjects.
        relatives, A list of related Subject_IDs concatenated together with a `|`.


    ``{prefix}/subjects_to_remove_pi_hat_gt{pi}.txt``

    Using a greeding algorithm, select subjects, with the most relationships,
    to prune from the dataset to eliminate relatedness.

    1. Uses ``PI_HAT`` from IBS/IBD estimation to identify pairwise groups of
    related subjects.
    2. Builds a graph where subjects (nodes) are connected by edges if their
    ``PI_HAT`` was above the ``pi_hat_threshold`` [1].
    3. Identifies subjects that have the most relatives (ie., nodes with max
    degree).
    4. Randomly selects and removes one of these highly connected subjects.
    Adds this subject to the output pruning list.
    5. Removes any subjects that no longer have a relative in the graph
    (i.e., isolated nodes with no edges).
    6. Repeats 3-5 until there are no subjects left in the graph.

    Saves a list of subjects to prune in a format compatible with PLINK's
    ``--remove`` option. In other words, a space separated table in the form
    of::

        Subject_ID1  Subject_ID1
        Subject_ID2  Subject_ID2
        ...
